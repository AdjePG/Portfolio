The first time I programmed was when I was 14 years old, using programs like <strong>Scratch</strong> and <strong>App Inventor</strong> to create very simple applications. Since then, my interest in <strong>programming</strong> has grown, and for the last <strong>5 years</strong>, I have been seriously dedicated to <strong>software development</strong>, creating <strong>innovative</strong> and <strong>highly useful</strong> projects, such as <strong>AIssistant</strong>.</p><br/><p>During this time, I have worked both professionally and personally. At <strong>SEIDOR</strong>, I learned and became professional as a <strong>programmer</strong>, standing out for <strong>automating and improving production processes</strong> for several companies, which highly valued my work.</p><br/><p>Currently, I continue to develop web projects using the <strong>latest tools</strong> and <strong>technologies</strong> in the market, integrating <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, a technology I consider key for the future.</p><br/><p>As a developer with experience in <strong>fullstack development</strong>, I am always ready to face any challenge, adapting and seeking innovative solutions.</p>",
